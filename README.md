## AutoHypixelAppeal

a simple hypixel appeal bot to get verification code in order to link hypixel forum account.

## Requirements

In order to run this bot, you'll need to have the following installed:

    Node.js
    npm (node package manager)

features soon to be added (hopefully)

    Dynamic account management - The bot currently uses a fixed set of accounts specified in the code. It would be beneficial to have a way to dynamically add/remove accounts from the bot.
    Better error handling - The bot does not have any error handling for various failure scenarios (such as server downtime). It would be beneficial to add error handling to handle these scenarios gracefully.
